This project is about solving the 8-tile puzzle. The 8-tile puzzle was invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles labeled 1 through 8 and an empty grid. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order.

You solve the puzzle by moving the tiles around. For each step, you can only move one of the neighbor tiles (left, right, top, bottom) into an empty grid. And all tiles must stay in the 3x3 grid.

Standard moves in an 8-tile puzzle, moving the center right tile to the bottom right or the bottom center tile to the bottom right.

Given these rules for the puzzle, this project generates a state space and solves this puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

Note that not all 8-tile puzzles are solvable. This project is currently designed to only solve puzzles that are solvable.

Unfortunately, there is likely an old bug in the code either during testing and the tests themselves or the puzzle solver causing it to not quite function as expected, though no fixes are planned at this time.
